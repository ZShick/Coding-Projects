Samples of my work on the Django Web App project.

This project was a Django Web app created using the PyCharm IDE.
I worked with a team and had daily SCRUM meetings and check-ins over Azure and Slack.
We were assigned stories to work on and utilized proper version control in order to keep everything organized.
The bulk of coding was done in Python, HTML, SQL, and CSS.
I worked on creating an app that one could use alongside a popular video game that would keep track of a users stats for each different character in the game.
I created the necessary views and styling using HTML and CSS so that entry forms and existing data could be displayed.
I also used Python to create the necessary Models and Controllers so that the database could store the users data for future reference and display.
Examples of my work on this project can be in this folder!
